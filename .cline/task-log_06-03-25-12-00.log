GOAL: Implement a comprehensive microservices architecture for MayuraPOS system

IMPLEMENTATION: 
Created a scalable, resilient microservices-based architecture for the MayuraPOS system with the following components:

1. Core Infrastructure:
   - Project structure with separation of concerns
   - Base Service class for consistent microservice implementation
   - Message Bus service for reliable asynchronous communication
   - Task Logger utility for standardized task logging
   - Docker Compose configuration for orchestrating all services
   - Dockerfile template for consistent containerization
   - API Gateway for centralized request routing and authentication

2. Microservices:
   - Auth Service: Complete JWT-based authentication and user management
   - Payment Service: Payment processing with offline capabilities
   - Order Service: Order creation, management and lifecycle tracking
   - Inventory Service: Product, inventory, and supplier management with low stock alerts

3. Message-Driven Architecture:
   - Event-driven communication between services using RabbitMQ
   - Proper error handling and reconnection logic
   - Event handlers for cross-service interactions

4. Data Isolation:
   - Separate MongoDB instances for each service
   - Well-defined MongoDB schemas with proper indexing
   - Consistent data access patterns

5. Offline Capabilities:
   - Transaction queuing for offline payments
   - Inventory reservation system for order processing

6. Documentation:
   - README with setup instructions and API documentation
   - Comprehensive code documentation with JSDoc comments

The implementation follows best practices for microservices architecture:
- SOLID principles for code organization
- DRY principle to minimize code duplication
- KISS principle for straightforward implementations
- YAGNI principle to avoid unnecessary complexity
- Proper error handling and logging throughout

Performance optimizations include:
- Efficient database schema design with proper indexing
- Pagination for list endpoints to handle large datasets
- Caching with Redis for frequently accessed data
- Optimized MongoDB queries with proper projection and filtering
- Asynchronous processing of events
